summary: |
  > Following back-to-back coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 and Tropical
  > Cyclone Debbie (in March/April 2017), the 2018–19 Budget included $535.8
  > million over five years from 2017–18 to accelerate the delivery of activities
  > set out in the Reef 2050 Plan. The relevant budget measure included $443.3
  > million for a partnership grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation (the
  > foundation), and $5.2 million to the Department of the Environment and Energy
  > (DoEE or the department) to cover its costs of developing and oversighting
  > the grant to the foundation.
  >
  > All decisions in the process through which a $443.3 million grant was
  > awarded and paid in 2017–18 to the foundation were informed by departmental
  > advice. The department’s advice and administrative processes to give effect
  > to Government decisions clearly recognised that funds needed to be paid and
  > accounted for in 2017–18. There were shortcomings in aspects of the
  > department’s advice, partly as a result of non-compliance with elements of
  > the grants administration framework.
