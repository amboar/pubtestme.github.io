summary: |
  > Applications were not soundly assessed in accordance with the program
  > guidelines. The eligibility requirements were not applied in full, and there
  > are indications of shortcomings in the assessment of the merit criterion most
  > directly related to the program outcomes. Requests for co-funding exemptions
  > were not appropriately considered and conflict of interest management was not
  > to a consistently appropriate standard. It is not clear that the documented
  > assessment procedures were sufficiently well developed, and there is
  > insufficient evidence that each of the more than 60 individuals that
  > undertook the assessments received adequate training.
