summary: |
  The Australian National Audit Office publishes the report of an audit
  undertaken at the request of the Shadow Attorney General, Mark Dreyfus QC MP,
  which concludes that the office of the Minister for Sport ran a grant
  assessment process parallel to Community Sport Infrastructure Grant Program
  to determine the recipients of grant money associated with the program.

  "A significant shortcoming was that, while the program guidelines identified
  that the Minister for Sport would approve CSIG funding, there are no records
  evidencing that the Minister was advised of the legal basis on which the
  Minister could undertake an approval role, and it is not evident to the ANAO
  what the legal authority was." - ANAO
