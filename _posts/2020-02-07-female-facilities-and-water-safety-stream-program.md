summary: |
  "The Coalition has quietly spent another $150m sports grant fund promised in
  last yearâ€™s budget without opening up the process to public applications.

  The $150m female facilities and water safety stream program, announced by the
  Coalition less than two months before the election, was funded in the 2019
  budget for the purpose of female changerooms and swimming pool upgrades.

  While there was an expectation among sports clubs that the program would be
  open for applications in the wake of the sports rorts scandal, the Department
  of Health has revealed that the $150m fund was all spent during the election
  campaign." - The Guardian Australia
